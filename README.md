## Get your favourite ***IPL match score***

This is my first python script . It runs after every 10 mins to get latest scores of the current IPL match going
and sends a **NOTIFICATION** to your **LINUX MACHINE**

To run this script you would need
>requests

>notify2

>BeautifulSoup

which can be install using pip
